## Tom Hale's PyTorch Udacity / Facebook scholarship course notes

These notes were written in Markdown with $\LaTeX$ formulae.

The formulae are converted to images by [TeXify](https://github.com/apps/texify).

I believe that I have attributed all materials, except the Udacity PyTorch Scholarship course, from which these notes are flagrantly copied ;)
