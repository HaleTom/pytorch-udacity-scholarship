## Tom Hale's PyTorch Udacity / Facebook scholarship course notes

These notes were written in Markdown with <img src="/tex/87181ad2b235919e0785dee664166921.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.69716744999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> formulae.

The formulae are converted to images by [TeXify](https://github.com/apps/texify).

I believe that I have attributed all materials, except the Udacity PyTorch Scholarship course, from which these notes are flagrantly copied ;)
