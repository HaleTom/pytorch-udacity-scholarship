## Tom Hale's PyTorch Udacity / Facebook scholarship course notes

These notes were written in Markdown with <img src="/tex/87181ad2b235919e0785dee664166921.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.69716744999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> formulae.

The formulae are converted to images by [TeXify](https://github.com/apps/texify).

I believe that I have attributed all materials, except the Udacity PyTorch Scholarship course, from which these notes are flagrantly copied ;)

### Google Colab starter code for `Image Classifier Project.ipynb`
It took me a while to work out how to get Google Colab setup for this project:

 * Install newly released PyTorch 1.0.0
 * Automatically download and unzip the dataset
 * Check and warn if GPU is not enabled
 * Helper functions
  * `image_show()`: Convert and show an image without the default gridlines
  * `label_to_text()`: Convert a tensor label to its label from `cat_to_name.json`

Here's the setup code: [`Google_Colab_startup_PyTorch_Challenge.ipynb`](code/Google_Colab_startup_PyTorch_Challenge.ipynb)

I took many hours creating this content which I hope will make your life easier.
